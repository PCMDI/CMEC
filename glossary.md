## Glossary 

Earth System Models (ESM): A coupled atmosphereâ€“ocean general circulation model in which a representation of the carbon cycle is included, allowing for interactive calculation of atmospheric CO2 orcompatible emissions. Additional components (e.g., atmospheric chemistry, ice sheets, dynamic vegetation, nitrogen cycle) may be included.
