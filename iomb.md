## The International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB) Package

The International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB) Package is used
to evaluate marine biogeochemistry models through comparisons with
observations.
IOMB provides a variety of in-depth diagnostics of marine biogeochmical
model variables on annual and inter-annual time scales. It compares a
growing number of variables with site-based, transect, regional, and
global observational data sets, and scores model performance based on a
combination of bias, RMSE, and seasonal cycle metrics. IOMB is useful
for detailed exploration of ocean biogeochemical model responses and
provides an interactive interface designed to enable the user to more
rapidly understand the underlying drivers of those responses.
IOMB uses the same code base as the [International Land Model Benchmarking
(ILAMB) Package](ilamb.html "ILAMB"), so some of the links below refer
to ILAMB instead of IOMB.
