## About

A primary motivation for CMEC is to analyze model simulations that are contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Virtually all the institutions worldwide involved in significant development of ESMs contribute simulations to CMIP. The 6th and latest phase (CMIP6; Meehl et al. 2014, Eyring et al., 2016) includes a partial but fundamental shift away from distinct CMIP phases with the advent of an ongoing core of benchmarking experiments known as the CMIP DECK (Diagnosis, Evaluation, Characterization of Klima – Klima being the German word for climate). The DECK includes a short list of experimental configurations that are routinely performed by ESM developers during their model development process. The DECK and “Historical” simulations provide a basis from which ESMs can be compared with available observations.
