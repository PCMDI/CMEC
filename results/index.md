## Results

In preparation for CMIP6, the CMEC capabilities will be used to provide summaries of CMIP5 simulations. At this time the results available here are subject to ongoing quality control and may be changing frequently. They are for research purposes only.

The sample results available include the following:

### Physical climate emphasis:

* [CMIP mean state and variability](physical.html "CMIP mean state and variability")
  - [Mean Climate][mean_clim]
  - [El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)][enso]
  - [Extratropical Modes of Variability][variability_modes]
  - [Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)][mjo]
  - [Monsoon Precipitation: Fractional Accumulation][monsoon]

### Biogeochemical climate emphasis:

* [ILAMB CMIP5 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP5/historical/ "ILAMB CMIP5 Results")
* [ILAMB CMIP6 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP6/historical/ "ILAMB CMIP6 Results")
* [ILAMB Community Land Model (CLM) Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CLM "ILAMB CLM Results")
* [IOMB CMIP5 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/IOMB/ "IOMB POP Results")

### Extreme weather emphasis:

* [Sample results from Wehner et al. (2015, J. Clim.)](teca_wehner_results.html "Sample results from Wehner et al. (2015, J. Clim.)")
