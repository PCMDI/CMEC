## Results

CMEC capabilities are being used to provide objective summaries of CMIP6 simulations and in some cases earlier generations. The results here are subject to ongoing quality control and are being updated frequently. They are for research purposes only.  Currently, available results include the following:

### Physical climate emphasis:

* [CMIP mean state and variability](physical.html "CMIP mean state and variability")
  - [Mean Climate][mean_clim]
  - [Benchmarking Simulated Precipitation][precip]
  - [El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)][enso]
  - [Extratropical Modes of Variability][variability_modes]
  - [Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)][mjo]
  - [Monsoon Characteristics (example)][monsoon]

### Biogeochemical climate emphasis:

* [ILAMB CMIP5 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP5/historical/ "ILAMB CMIP5 Results")
* [ILAMB CMIP6 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP6/historical/ "ILAMB CMIP6 Results")
* [ILAMB Community Land Model (CLM) Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CLM "ILAMB CLM Results")
* [IOMB CMIP5 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/IOMB/ "IOMB POP Results")
