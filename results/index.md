## Results

CMEC capabilities are being used to provide objective summaries of CMIP6 simulations and in some cases earlier generations. The results here are subject to ongoing quality control and are being updated frequently. They are for research purposes only.  Currently results available include the following:

### Physical climate emphasis:

* [CMIP mean state and variability](physical.html "CMIP mean state and variability")
  - [Mean Climate][mean_clim]
  - [El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)][enso]
  - [Extratropical Modes of Variability][variability_modes]
  - [Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)][mjo]
  - [Seasonal Monsoon (example)][monsoon]
  -  Benchmarking Simulated Precipitation (coming soon) 

### Biogeochemical climate emphasis:

* [ILAMB CMIP5 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP5/historical/ "ILAMB CMIP5 Results")
* [ILAMB CMIP6 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP6/historical/ "ILAMB CMIP6 Results")
* [ILAMB Community Land Model (CLM) Results](https://www.ilamb.org/CLM "ILAMB CLM Results")
* [IOMB CMIP5 Results](https://www.ilamb.org/IOMB/ "IOMB POP Results")

### Extreme weather emphasis:

* [Sample results from Wehner et al. (2015, J. Clim.)](teca_wehner_results.html "Sample results from Wehner et al. (2015, J. Clim.)")
