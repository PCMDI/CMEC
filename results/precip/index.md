# Benchmarking Simulated Precipitation


Welcome to the results site for benchmarking simulated precipitation in Earth System Models (ESMs)! This effort has been inspired by the outcomes of the [July 2019 DOE workshop](https://science.osti.gov/-/media/ber/pdf/community-resources/2020/RGMA_Precip_Metrics_workshop.pdf) (summerized by [Pendergrass et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0318.1)). That workshop was motivated by discussions that have taken place in recent years in various working groups of the WCRP including the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) and Working Group on Coupled Models (WGCM).
