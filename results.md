The sample results available include the following:

### Physical climate emphasis:

* [CMIP5 AMIP and Historical climatologies](physical_results.html "CMIP5 AMIP and Historical climatologies")
* [CMIP5 inter-annual variability](physical_results_extropvar.html "CMIP5 Historical extra-tropical variability")


### Biogeochemical climate emphasis:

* [ILAMB CMIP5 Results](http://ilamb.ornl.gov/CMIP5 "ILAMB CMIP5 Results")
* [ILAMB E3SM Land Model (ELM) Results](http://ilamb.ornl.gov/ELM "ILAMB ELM Results")
