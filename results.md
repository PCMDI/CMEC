## Results

In preparation for CMIP6, the CMEC capabilities will be used to provide summaries of CMIP5 simulations. At this time the results available here are subject to ongoing quality control and may be changing frequently. They are for research purposes only.

The sample results available include the following:

### Physical climate emphasis:

* [CMIP5 AMIP and Historical climatologies](physical_results.html "CMIP5 AMIP and Historical climatologies")
* [CMIP5 inter-annual variability](physical_results_extropvar.html "CMIP5 Historical extra-tropical variability")


### Biogeochemical climate emphasis:

* [ILAMB CMIP5 Results](http://ilamb.ornl.gov/CMIP5 "ILAMB CMIP5 Results")
* [ILAMB E3SM Land Model (ELM) Results](http://ilamb.ornl.gov/ELM "ILAMB ELM Results")
* [ILAMB Community Land Model (CLM) Results](http://ilamb.ornl.gov/CLM "ILAMB CLM Results")
* [IOMB Parallel Ocean Program (POP) Results](http://ilamb.ornl.gov/IOMB/ "IOMB POP Results")

### Extreme weather emphasis:

* [Sample results from Wehner et al. (2015, J. Clim.)](teca_wehner_results.html "Sample results from Wehner et al. (2015, J. Clim.)")
