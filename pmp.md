## The PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP)

### Overview

The PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP) provides a diverse suite of relatively robust
high-level summary statistics that gauge differences between models and
observations. The emphasis is on the physical system in Earth System Models
(ESMs) and their component sub-models. The PMP provides holistic summaries
spanning space and time scales for the simulated atmosphere, ocean, ice and
land with the CMEC <a href="{{site.baseurl}}results.html">examples available on
this site</a> highlighting atmospheric characteristics.

The goals of the PMP are to:
<ul>
  <li>Provide objective performance summaries of all CMIP DECK + Historical
  simulations</li>
  <li>Incorporate results spanning six generations of CMIP/AMIP, and to track
  performance changes through eras of climate model evolution</li>
  <li>Enable modeling groups to use the PMP in their own analysis/development
  workflow, so to generate near instant feedback at the time of the model
  simulation completion, rather than await for feedback through the multi-year
  process that occurs through peer- publication</li>
  <li>Collaborate with US and international expert teams to further diversify the
  suite of objective tests and expand these in new and novel ways</li>
  <li>Further leverage and advance the conventions and protocols that were developed
  by PCMDI for CMIP, and use these to facilitate open source software
  collaboration across research groups and institutions</li>
</ul>

The PMP summaries include metrics from PCMDIâ€™s research, which rely on several
summary diagrams designed by PCMDI (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2000JD900719"
target="_blank">Taylor, 2001</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2007JD008972"
target="_blank">Gleckler et al., 2008</a>) that are now widely adopted by the
research community. Well-established metrics generated by various expert teams
(e.g., <a href="http://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/pacific" target="_blank">CLIVAR
Pacific Region Panel</a> for ENSO) are being implemented into the PMP. The
software leverages advanced Python-based model analysis tools that have been
developed with over two decades of support from the U.S. Department of Energy,
along with the <a href="https://esgf.llnl.gov/" target="_blank">Earth System Grid
Federation</a> (ESGF), <a href="https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip5/"
target="_blank">CMIP5</a>, <a href="https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip3/"
target="_blank">CMIP3</a> and earlier data holdings based
on-site at LLNL

As PMP development continues, we welcome collaborations from modeling groups
and expert teams to further expand and improve the comprehensiveness of the
calculated metrics.
