## Capabilities

The U.S. Department of Energy is coordinating the development and
distribution of community software tools designed to evaluate the fidelity
of Earth system models and their component models.  Collectively called
the [Coodinated Model Evaluation Capabilities (CMEC)](./ "CMEC"), these
tools offer a wide range of benchmarking and diagnostic capabilities
described below. Tools currently participating in CMEC:

* The PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP)

* The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) Package

* The International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB) Package

* The Toolkit for Extremes Climate Analysis (TECA)

<!-- PMP -->
<div class="span4 box">
<h3><a class="reference internal" href="pmp.html">The PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP)</a></h3>
<p>PMP provides a diverse suite of relatively robust high level summary statistics across space and time scales, gauging the differences between models and observations.  Results are available for the simulated atmosphere, ocean, ice and land - with current examples emphasizing atmospheric characterisitics.  PMP is useful for producing quick, high-level summaries of new simulations and putting them into the context of all previous generations of AMIP and CMIP.</p>

<!-- ILAMB -->
<div class="span4 box">
<h3><a class="reference internal" href="ilamb.html">The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) Package</a></h3>
<p>ILAMB provides a variety of in-depth diagnostics of more than 24
terrestrial biogeochemical and hydrological model variables on annual
and inter-annual time scales. It compares these variables with over
60 site-based, regional, and global observational data sets, and
scores model performance based on a combination bias, RMSE, and seasonal
cycle metrics. Relationships between many biogeochemical variables
and physical driver variables are calculated from model results and
compared with observational estimates. ILAMB is useful for detailed
exploration of land biogeochemical and hydrological model responses and
provides an interactive interface designed to enable the user to more
rapidly understand the underlying drivers of those responses.</p>

<!-- IOMB -->
<div class="span4 box">
<h3><a class="reference internal" href="iomb.html">The International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB) Package</a></h3>
<p>IOMB provides a variety of in-depth diagnostics of marine biogeochmical
model variables on annual and inter-annual time scales. It compares a
growing number of variables with site-based, transect, regional, and
global observational data sets, and scores model performance based on a
combination of bias, RMSE, and seasonal cycle metrics. IOMB is useful
for detailed exploration of ocean biogeochemical model responses and
provides an interactive interface designed to enable the user to more
rapidly understand the underlying drivers of those responses.</p>
<center><a border="0" href="iomb.html"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/iomb_temperature_sm.png"></a></center>
<p>IOMB uses the same code base as ILAMB (described above). The links below refer to ILAMB instead of IOMB.</p>
